machine learning for materials science: tutorial 1

### Curie temperature data
Tc data is taken from [repository](https://github.com/msg-byu/ML-for-CurieTemp-Predictions)
that comes with the paper  
Nelson, James, and Stefano Sanvito. "Predicting the Curie temperature of ferromagnets using machine learning." Physical Review Materials 3.10 (2019): 104405.
